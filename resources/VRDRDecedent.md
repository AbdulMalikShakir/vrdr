# VRDR Decedent

{{render:VRDRDecedent.jpg}}

Information about a person who has died as it is collected for inclusion within the death certificate.  The age may be provided using different units of measure, i.e., years, months, days, and minutes depending on how long the person lived. Currently, when information is being passed to NCHS, additional decedent records are provided, one for each alias.
